# Project Identity

Project name: House of Cards  
Always refer to this project by this name, not by filenames.

# Architecture Interpretation Rules

Although the code defines classes (e.g., AnimationPlayer),
this project is **not considered object-oriented**.

Classes are used only as:
- Namespaces
- State containers

There is:
- No inheritance
- No polymorphism
- No object collaboration

Always describe the architecture as **procedural / functional**, not OOP.

# Language and Style

- Python 3.11
- Terminal-based rendering
- Performance-sensitive loop logic
