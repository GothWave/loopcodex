# loopcodex

`loopcodex` is a Python-based project offering utilities for handling, indexing, and analyzing loops or repetitive code patterns (e.g., musical loops, programmatic sequences, or algorithmic code segments). This repository contains the core logic, rules definitions, and CLI interfaces needed to manipulate and evaluate such patterns effectively.

## Features

At a high level, `loopcodex` aims to provide:

- Pattern detection and classification of loops in text or code.  
- Rule-based transformations and normalization of repetitive structures.  
- CLI interface for batch processing of directories or files.  
- Extensible rule sets for custom loop codification.

*(Expand these once core functionality is confirmed.)*
